# Movies-Recommendation-System
I have created a Movie Recommendation System which recommends and predicts all the hollywood English Movies.<br/>
Here i have used TMDB movies dataset to collect a list of data to recommend to the users.

# Algorithm Used 
i have used Count Vectorisation Cosine Similarity Algorithm which is suggesting movies on the basis of tags and popularity.<br/>
Indirectly  It is recommwnding movies in the basis of searching first and then Sorting..
